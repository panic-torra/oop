"heathens"

---

All my friends are heathens. Take it slow
Wait for them to ask you who you know

---

Welcome to the room of people
Who have rooms of people that they loved one day
Docked away
Just because we check the guns at the door
Doesn't mean our brains will change from hand grenades

NO ONE'll never know the psychopath sitting next to you
NO ONE'll never know the murderer sitting next to you
NO ONE'll think, "How'd I get here, sitting next to you?"
But after all I've said
Please don't forget
